<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.1</h3>
<br>
<p>
    This update contains a few hotfixes
    <br><br>
    • The extension would not load on new tabs in Firefox and would require the browser to be restarted. This has been fixed.
    • The help menu HTML appeared to have been broken by a last-minute change. This has been fixed.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.0</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The 2.0 update to Youtube Tabs has finally arrived!
    <br><br>
    In this update, the codebase and UI have been completely overhauled. The extension has been almost completely rebuilt from the ground up in order to make it more maintainable, reliable, and efficient.
    The UI has also been given a thorough makeover and redesign to make it easier and more pleasant to use (and less scalding to look at).
    <br><br>
    Since the purpose of this update was to rebuild the extension and overhaul it, there are only few new features.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Favorite Badges</h3>
<br>
