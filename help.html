<br>
<p>
    • Resolved the issue with the extension that wasn't working properly by switching accounts within YouTube.
    <br>
    • Added a closing button to the right corner of the dialog box and relocated the export button next to the import button.
</p>

<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.7</h3>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">June. 15th 2023</h3>
<br>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Mar. 5th 2023</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Hotfix time!
    <br><br>
    • An issue suddenly cropped up where the Youtube video interaction menu would flicker when hovered over. This has been resolved.
    <br>
    • In the process, resolved an issue with the subscribe button widget. That is now working again.
    <br>
    • That also appears to have resolved an issue where adding a new subscription wouldn't fully load the 'add to tab' pop-up.
</p>

<br><br>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Apr. 1st 2023</h3>

    <br>
    • No, this is not an April Fools joke.
</p>

    • Bug fix: Fixed an issue where the old localstorage objects were migrated but not deleted, causing saving to no longer work for users who existed before version 2.0.0 (Sorry about that! Thanks for reporting this Kaiserd).
    <br>
    • Happy New Year! Have a blessed 2023!
</p>

<br><br>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Dec. 12th 2022</h3>

    • Bug fix: Brand new installs of the extension would throw an error when attempting to create new tabs. This has been resolved. Thanks for the bug report, Harish!
    <br>
    • Bug fix: The edit tab menu was broken. This has been resolved.
    <br>
    • Bug fix: The new subscription quick-menu would not overflow properly when selecting the badge options button. This has been fixed.

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.2</h3>
<br>

<br>
<p>
    This update contains a few hotfixes
    <br><br>

    <br>
    • The help menu HTML appeared to have been broken by a last-minute change. This has been fixed.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.0</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The 2.0 update to Youtube Tabs has finally arrived!
    <br><br>
    In this update, the codebase and UI have been completely overhauled. The extension has been almost completely rebuilt from the ground up in order to make it more maintainable, reliable, and efficient.
    The UI has also been given a thorough makeover and redesign to make it easier and more pleasant to use (and less scalding to look at).
    <br><br>
    Since the purpose of this update was to rebuild the extension and overhaul it, there are only few new features.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Quick-Menu for New Subscriptions</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The quick-menu allows you to immediately organize a new subscription, instead of having to search for it in the subscriptions panel.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Favorite Badges</h3>
<br>
<p>
    You can now favorite any subscription badge to have it sorted first.
</p>
