<h3 style="text-align: center;">Version 2.0.0</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The 2.0 update to Youtube Tabs has finally arrived!
    <br><br>
    In this update, the codebase and UI have been completely overhauled. The extension has been almost completely rebuilt from the ground up in order to make it more maintainable, reliable, and efficient.
    The UI has also been given a thorough makeover and redesign to make it easier and more pleasant to use (and less scalding to look at).
    <br><br>
    Since the purpose of this update was to rebuild the extension and overhaul it, there are only few new features.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Quick-Menu for New Subscriptions</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The quick-menu allows you to immediately organize a new subscription, instead of having to search for it in the subscriptions panel.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Favorite Badges</h3>
<br>
<p>
    You can now favorite any subscription badge to have it sorted first.
